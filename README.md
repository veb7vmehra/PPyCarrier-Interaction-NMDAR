# PPyCarrier-Interaction-NMDAR
This is a Hardcoded Simulation of the Brain's Inter Neural Space, simulating how a PolyPyrrole Nanocarrier will interact the Open State NMDA Receptors. We  have simulated it in both 2d and in 3d. For 2d Simulation I have used python with pygames and for the 3d simulation I have used game engine Godot with GDScript.
